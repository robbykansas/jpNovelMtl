<body><h1>2 Recruiting members &#x2461;</h1>The inside of the building, which was probably open as a bar, was incomparably warmer than the outside.<br/><br/>A hint of alcohol remains. The tables that would normally be placed there have been cleared away and moved to the left and right, and applicants to join the club are lining up inside the spacious store.<br/><br/>The air is white due to human heat. Ruda, who was guided along with me, opened her eyes wide at the sight.<br/>Apparently, she had completely forgotten about her troubles outside.<br/><br/>&quot;Wow... are they all hunters?&quot;<br/><br/>There are tables scattered throughout the store, and several members wearing white uniforms are seated at each table. He is a member of a party belonging to the clan &quot;First Step&quot;.<br/><br/>Even if you just say it&apos;s a party affiliated with &quot;Footprints,&quot; there are a lot of them. Some parties have many famous members, while others only have a well-known leader. Some parties look for attackers, while others look for skills.<br/>Each person who wants to join the group goes to the table of the party they want to join and takes a test. The content varies from party to party, from interviews to practical exams, and some parties seem to place emphasis on inspiration.<br/><br/>asked Ruda, who was not hiding her confusion.<br/><br/>&#x201C;Is this your first time?&#x201D;<br/><br/>&#x201C;&#x2026;Is Cry different?&#x201D;<br/><br/>&#x201C;&#x2026;I think it&#x2019;s my fifth time.&#x201D;<br/><br/>&quot;Five times... so many times... I-I&apos;m sorry.&quot;<br/><br/>I don&apos;t really understand, but Ruda seemed apologetic and apologized.<br/><br/>&quot;No, it&apos;s not really...I think it&apos;s probably not the first time for many of the people who came today.&quot;<br/><br/>Hunters are meritocratic. Talented people are quickly taken away, but that doesn&apos;t mean those without talent don&apos;t have a chance.<br/>I&apos;m sure there are people like me who have given up on their own talent, but are clinging to the slightest chance. That kind of unwillingness to give up is also one of his talents.<br/><br/>For now, just a confirmation. I distanced myself from the rows of tables, moved to a corner near the entrance, and looked around.<br/><br/>It seems there are more parties recruiting members this time than usual.<br/>Although it is said that they are recruiting members for Footprints, not all parties belonging to it recruit members every time, but most of them are recruiting this time. Naturally, the number of people wishing to join will increase.<br/>Is that why there was a line outside?<br/><br/>Even though we were just lined up a little close to each other, Ruda spoke to me in a familiar manner.<br/><br/>&quot;Cry, if you don&apos;t mind, could you tell me some things? I don&apos;t know much about this kind of thing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;...That&apos;s fine. It&apos;s not a bad idea to do a favor to a skilled hunter.&quot;<br/><br/>At the very least, she probably won&apos;t be a vessel that ends up at level 3. Unless she dies.<br/>Hearing my words, Ruda&apos;s expression softens ever so slightly.<br/><br/>&quot;It&apos;s been a long time since I came to the Imperial Capital. I know most of the famous hunters. I think this is a good chance.&quot;<br/><br/>First of all, even if you participate in a party, it doesn&apos;t have to be a random party.<br/><br/>There are roles that each party is recruiting for, and an activity policy. Well, it&apos;s not wrong to say that if you can join an excellent party, you&apos;ll feel safe, but even if you can join a good party, you might not be able to fit in.<br/>If there is too much difference in talent between the members, it will be very difficult. I think Ruda is on the right track, but hunters from all over the world who are confident in their abilities are gathering in the imperial capital.<br/><br/>They may look human on the surface, but they are definitely a completely different life form. My friends were like that too.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&apos;t know what Ruda wants to do or what she can do. She has a dagger, so it&apos;s probably more about combat than other skills.&quot;<br/><br/>Check the stares, their clothes, and their equipment. Besides the dagger, a small leather bag hangs from his waist so that it doesn&apos;t hinder his movement. It probably contains tools for picking.<br/><br/>When a solo hunter joins a party, the easiest way to join is as a combat job.<br/><br/>The fact that they were able to become solo hunters means that they were able to survive the monsters and ``phantoms&apos;&apos; that attacked them all by themselves, and they tend to have high combat ability.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you do not have a great track record, you will be avoided if you join a role that requires special skills. As solo players must be able to do everything from detecting traps to searching for enemies and unlocking locks to combat, their individual skills are often inferior to those who mastered them in a party.<br/><br/>However, he probably knows that too, so he won&apos;t hold any grudge against you if you confront him with that fact.<br/><br/>As Ruda waited for her words with a serious expression, I pointed towards the back of the room and continued.<br/><br/>&quot;First of all, there is a rule in this room as well. The party in the back has a higher level.&quot;<br/><br/>Just as hunters have certification levels, clans and parties each have their own level determined by the exploration cooperative. There are also disparities between parties belonging to the same clan.<br/><br/>He points to the large table in the back, where a large number of hunters are gathered.<br/><br/>&quot;That&apos;s the strongest party we&apos;re recruiting members for this time - &apos;Sons of the Holy Spirit (Ark Brave).&apos; Have you ever heard of them? The average age is 21 years old, and only six people conquered a level 7 treasure hall. &quot;The best of the best&quot;<br/><br/>A monster that stands out among the monsters that infest the imperial capital. All of the members have abilities that make it seem like they have been favored by God, and the leader is hailed as a hero.<br/>By the way, the ``White Wolf&apos;s Den&apos;&apos; that Ruda was trying to challenge is a level 3 treasure hall. The difficulty level of the certification level set in her treasure hall is nearly ten times different as you go up one level, so there is a world of difference between her and her current level.<br/><br/>&quot;If you can join that party, success is guaranteed. Even if you can&apos;t join... even if you get even a little praise from the members over there, scouts will probably come from other parties.&quot;<br/><br/>Even if you are a solo artist or have little experience, you have probably heard of the name. As expected, Ruda seemed to be a little withdrawn, and she asked quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;...By the way, I just wanted to ask... do you think there&apos;s a possibility?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&apos;s up to Ruda. Well, as far as I know, &apos;Son of the Holy Spirit (Ark Brave)&apos; has never taken members at a place like this.&quot;<br/><br/>He is one of the biggest names in the imperial capital. If you&apos;re a young person, this is definitely one of your first or second parties.<br/><br/>The members are already completely solidified, and the hunters who are flocking to recruit probably don&apos;t think they can join. The people who flock there want to see their faces at a glance, or they want to connect with them even if just a little.<br/><br/>As Ruda looked at the crowd of people, she took a deep breath without complaining.<br/>As soon as she heard that it was a Level 7 Treasure Hall, she must have realized that it would be difficult for her to do it on her own.<br/><br/>She goes on to introduce more and more parties. Most of them are names that you will have heard at least once if you have been a hunter in this imperial capital for several months.<br/>Ruda was solo, so she just didn&apos;t know about it, and it was information that would come easily to her if she tried to look it up.<br/><br/>She points and counts one by one. She also appeared at a rare party that she would not have attended in previous years.<br/>It seems that most of the footprints are participating in this recruitment of members.<br/><br/>Ruda said, sounding taken aback after listening to the long story.<br/><br/>&quot;...Cry, you know a lot. Just hearing about it makes me tired.&quot;<br/><br/>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s only natural.&#x201D;<br/><br/>&quot;...I don&apos;t know if I can ask, but where do you want to be?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&apos;t have any particular aspirations...I can&apos;t do anything...&quot;<br/><br/>I don&apos;t have a specialty. It&apos;s not all-purpose, and you can&apos;t do everything well. Less than skillful poverty. That was me.<br/><br/>He has no courage and no passion for hunters. The small amount of passion I had when I still believed in my talent disappeared before I knew it.<br/>Being a hunter has a great return, but it&apos;s a dangerous job. There is even a statistic that 70% of them die in the treasure hall. I didn&apos;t have the courage to take that risk.<br/><br/>I used to make excuses like I didn&apos;t have talent like my friends, but that was probably the biggest problem. I feel like I&apos;m going to puke.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes...then, if you don&apos;t mind, would you like to join me in a party?&quot;<br/><br/>In response to my weak words, Ruda makes a suggestion in an artificially cheerful voice.<br/>&#x3000;He&apos;s probably serious. My heart tightens and it becomes difficult to breathe.<br/><br/>Ruda is a good person among all the bastard hunters. I&apos;m sure those words aren&apos;t a joke or anything.<br/>However, it was an unbearable pain for me to have to be the one holding me back.<br/><br/>&quot;I appreciate your suggestion, but I don&apos;t need your sympathy. For the future, Ruda should join a party that is suitable for her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;...That&apos;s right...&quot;<br/><br/>He gently touched the silver chain hanging from his belt. The cold touch calms my heart a little.<br/><br/>Then Ruda suddenly said something to change the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Recruitment table for &quot;Son of the Holy Spirit (Ark Brave)&quot;. He looked at a large table with no one seated at the back and pointed at it exaggeratedly.<br/><br/>&quot;Oh, what? Hey, now that I think about it, why haven&apos;t you cleaned up that empty table over there?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hey, you guys really came here without knowing anything.&quot;<br/><br/>&#x201C;!?&#x201D;<br/><br/>While we were lining up outside, a large man approached me with a grin on his face.<br/>His face was red from the heat. His well-developed biceps and wild, studded armor look even more ferocious under the light.<br/><br/>Perhaps because of the results, I&apos;m in a much better mood than before.<br/><br/>Ruda, who was disappointed, frowned and glared at the big man.<br/><br/>&quot;...Do you need something for us? You&apos;ll get angry again.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&apos;t say such nonsense. Mr. Greg, the senior hunter, is going to show you the rules.&quot;<br/><br/>Mr. Greg...I&apos;ve never heard of it. However, I only know a few of them - the top ones, which any hunter with a little knowledge of the industry would know.<br/>There are many strong Hunters that I don&apos;t know about, and it&apos;s possible that they haven&apos;t even reached their peak in the first place.<br/><br/>&quot;That table over there is the table of a certain party that started this &apos;Footprints&apos; together with the &apos;Son of the Holy Spirit (Ark Brave).&apos;However, I guess you didn&apos;t come today either.&quot;<br/><br/>&#x201C;Did you start a party?&#x201D;<br/><br/>As Ruda blinks, Greg-sama continues in a low voice.<br/><br/>``The Footprints have been recruiting members many times, but today there are more people than usual.The ``Holy Spirit&apos;&apos; who recently conquered the Level 7 Treasure Hall without missing a single person is also here, ``Kurokin&apos;&apos; and ``Holy Thunder&apos;&apos;, who didn&apos;t recruit, are also here. And...you see, besides the party, there are people with footprint marks standing all over the place, right?&apos;&apos;<br/><br/>Greg-sama glances at the hunter man who crosses his arms grumpily against the wall.<br/><br/>The clothes are not the uniforms worn by hunters recruiting for parties, but if you look closely, you can see buttons and accessories that resemble footprints hanging in inconspicuous places such as the collar and sleeves.<br/>There is a rule that members of a clan must wear the symbol somewhere visible.<br/><br/>&#x201C;Originally, there is little point in having members who already belong to the Footprints come here without even recruiting purposes. There is a reason for that.&#x201D;<br/><br/>I paused at the way he said it.<br/><br/>Mr. Greg seems to have done a lot of research, but I only know a little more.<br/><br/>&quot;...They are hunters who belong to Footprints solo.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;!? I belong to a solo group...Is that really the case?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&apos;s at least one person in a party... You can only join a clan as a party, but you can join if you apply for a party solo and register for the exploration cooperative. It requires a lot of skill though...&quot;<br/><br/>So to speak, Ruda was either reckless or had a little bit of luck and talent.<br/><br/>He averted his gaze from the man and pointed towards the girl who was wandering around looking bored near an empty table.<br/>A black leather battle uniform that tightened around her body. She is a girl with short cut black hair who wears a dagger hanging from her belt and an outfit that emphasizes her ease of movement. Her age is probably younger than Ruda.<br/><br/>&quot;This is Tino Shade. He&apos;s a Level 4 solo member of Footprints. He&apos;s a famous member.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Such a small girl...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;...It&apos;s better not to say unnecessary things. Age, appearance, and short temper have nothing to do with each other.&quot;<br/><br/>The role is a thief.<br/>Although he does not steal things, he is so called because of his ability to search for enemies, block signs, and unlock traps and locks. He is a higher level of Ruda who can conquer the White Wolf&apos;s nest by himself. One of the footprint monsters.<br/>Greg-sama turns his attention to me for the first time. It&apos;s an interesting look.<br/><br/>&quot;...He didn&apos;t really look like a hunter, but he did quite a bit of research.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Gathering information is important. Besides, she&apos;s actually an acquaintance&apos;s disciple.&quot;<br/><br/>I pulled down the hood I was still wearing to hide my face. More specifically, she is a disciple of a friend.<br/>In other words, my friend was a monster even higher than a monster. Oh my god!<br/><br/>&quot;acquaintance?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re here even though you&apos;re solo...&quot;<br/><br/>Maybe he stopped being solo and came looking for a new party to join. Recruitment of members is not necessarily limited to external parties.<br/>Master Greg folded his arms arrogantly and smiled as I tilted my head.<br/><br/>&quot;That&apos;s it. That&apos;s it. There were rumors about why they were gathering. Today, one of the founding parties of the First Step, which had not been recruiting additional party members for a long time... &#x2015;I heard that ``Stoguri&apos;&apos; is recruiting members for the first time in several years.&apos;&apos;</body></html>
