<body><h1>3 Recruiting members &#x2462;</h1>It creates an illusion as if the world is cut out only in this place.<br/>Not noticing my situation, Master Greg curled his lips into a grin.<br/><br/>&quot;The &apos;Mourning Spirits&apos; are a small group of elite people. Unless it&apos;s an opportunity like this, we won&apos;t be able to meet them, and it&apos;s unlikely that they&apos;ll have a chance to join the party. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be brave enough to show their faces if the opportunity arises.&quot;<br/><br/>An excited voice. Ruda&apos;s eyes widened at the amount of heat he felt.<br/><br/>``Mourning Spirit&apos;&apos;. Her stomach knotted at the word.<br/><br/>That was several years ago. It was the name of the party I and my friends threw when we came to the imperial capital from the countryside.<br/>A young party that quickly rose to prominence with its five monster members. Now, in this imperial capital, it is also a young party that rivals the ``Son of the Holy Spirit&apos;&apos; (Ark Brave).<br/><br/>The official name is ``Strange Grief&apos;&apos;.<br/><br/>Before I knew it, my throat was dry. I&apos;m sweating strangely, probably because I&apos;m nervous.<br/>Please don&apos;t call me that name. I want to appeal to you, but it would be too unnatural to say something like that now.<br/><br/>Put the hood back on. As if to hide herself for a little while.<br/><br/>&quot;What&apos;s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?&quot;<br/><br/>Ruda asked me with concern as I shrunk and trembled. I feel like I&apos;m going to puke.<br/><br/>&quot;Well, it seems like it was just a fake joke. It was pretty boring, so I had high hopes for it...&quot;<br/><br/>Greg shrugs his shoulders.<br/><br/>Not only ``Son of the Holy Spirit (Ark Brave)&apos;&apos; and ``Strange Grief&apos;&apos;, but the parties that belong to ``Footprints&apos;&apos; are generally of high level.<br/>Even if Mr. Greg is short-tempered, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s going to complain just because one party didn&apos;t show up.<br/><br/>&quot;Hey, what do you mean! Where&apos;s the &apos;Mourning Spirit&apos;!&quot;<br/><br/>However, it seems that some people were planning to complain.<br/><br/>All eyes were drawn to the sudden loud voice.<br/>In front of him was a boy with fiery red hair. Carrying on his back was a two-handed great sword that couldn&apos;t be wielded with average strength. He is short, but even through his clothes you can see that he has a well-toned physique.<br/><br/>As he has said many times, a hunter&apos;s strength is directly proportional to his impatience.<br/>He had the courage to shout out in public what no one else had said - even Mr. Greg.<br/>Eyes that are confident of victory, even when everyone around him is his enemy. And he probably has the ability to back it up.<br/><br/>The great sword emitted a unique shine that was not made by human hands. He&apos;s probably the so-called Noble Phantasm that he got in the treasure hall.<br/><br/>Although he is clearly younger than me, he gives off an air of danger that is too dangerous to be dismissed as just an ignorant person.<br/><br/>&quot;I have no business with small fry. I heard that the top guy was going to show up, so I came all the way here!&quot;<br/><br/>The boy continues to be abusive without asking for anyone&apos;s consent.<br/><br/>&quot;You&apos;re young. Are you really planning on making everyone here your enemy?&quot;<br/><br/>Greg looked at him curiously, and he muttered something.<br/>Although he has the appearance of a rough-and-tumble person, he seems to have a certain sense of discretion considering his age.<br/><br/>Horizontal connections are important for treasure hunters. If you cause a problem, it will spread quickly. No matter how great your ability is, sometimes it just isn&apos;t enough.<br/><br/>It probably didn&apos;t matter until now, but there are only people here who have a favorable view of footprints. Moreover, there are many talented people. It&apos;s not uncommon to have a treasure.<br/><br/>There was no sign of anyone around him stopping the boy who was getting angry at the center. It&apos;s probably because those words represent the thoughts of a certain percentage of the hunters here.<br/><br/>And the other hunters were staring at me as if they were idiots.<br/><br/>The boy intimidated the members of the Footprints on each table with glaring eyes that gave the impression of murderous intent. However, the majority of people are not interested in them.<br/>There is no one more accustomed to handling naughty creatures than a high-class hunter.<br/><br/>The boy screamed even more as if he was getting heated up. It looked like a threatening beast.<br/><br/>&quot;I&apos;m a man who will become the strongest hunter someday, and I&apos;m already at level 4! I was thinking of recruiting the strongest man in the Imperial City as a friend, but I&apos;m tired of it!&quot;<br/><br/>He said something amazing. Don&apos;t be a big deal, this guy. Be big or die.<br/><br/>She&apos;s probably still in her mid-teens. Level 4 is definitely amazing at that age. His sky-high self-confidence and arrogant attitude are not something to be admired, but if he can continue to win, it will be justice.<br/><br/>That was the world of hunters.<br/><br/>Ruda secretly twitches her cheeks. Apparently he was shocked that the idiot was at a higher level than him.<br/>But it&apos;s okay, there&apos;s still a possibility that he raised his level in the party.<br/><br/>A member of the Footprints finally approached the boy who was stepping on the ground.<br/>These aren&apos;t the people who were recruiting for the party who got fired. This is Tino Shade, who was standing alone in the corner of the room a while ago.<br/><br/>He casually walked up to the boy&apos;s side and looked down at him with cold eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Oh? What the hell!?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing. I don&apos;t need it in my house.&quot;<br/><br/>A deep, chilling voice.<br/>The other Footprint members, who were unfazed by the gun thrown at them by the boy, hurriedly stepped in between them.<br/><br/>&quot;Hey, Tino. Today&apos;s purpose is to recruit members, don&apos;t cause a commotion!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&apos;ll be over in an instant. I&apos;ll kick you out. If I had an older sister, I&apos;d definitely do that. The one who&apos;s going to put you in Strange Grief is me. I promised you that you&apos;d let me in when you get stronger.&quot; be&quot;<br/><br/>Close range. This courage in the face of a great sword with a long reach. His short temper is similar to that of a foolish boy.<br/>The other members persuade Tino, who looks like he&apos;s about to pounce. I don&apos;t know which one is the bad guy.<br/><br/>&quot;Leave the idiots alone, it&apos;s a waste of time. You&apos;ve been ordered to do it as peacefully as possible! Even we will be scolded for collective responsibility!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ah!? Who&apos;s the idiot! I&apos;ll kill you!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&apos;s you, you idiot! Just die quietly! I was able to do my job!&quot;<br/><br/>To the boy who behaves like a thug, the members of Footprints respond like a thug.<br/>Even though they were called high-ranking clans, they were essentially the same.<br/><br/>The monsters are all looking for an opportunity to use their power.<br/><br/>Adding fuel to the fire, the commotion continues to spread. It was still better since there was nothing around, but it wouldn&apos;t be strange to pull out a weapon right now. And once the weapon is drawn, it&apos;s impossible to stop it halfway. The fight won&apos;t stop until one of them dies.<br/><br/>A fight between treasure hunters is a disaster.<br/><br/>It&apos;s still better since everyone here is a hunter, but if they start using the ``Noble Phantasms&apos;&apos; that many of them probably possess, one or two buildings like this will easily be blown away.<br/><br/>&quot;Oh! Oh my gosh! Show me the power of &apos;footprints&apos;!&quot;<br/><br/>Mr. Greg begins to provoke him in a vulgar voice. As if caught in the act, everyone around her started to provoke her. Among them were members of Footprints. It&apos;s out of control now.<br/><br/>I pulled on Ruda&apos;s sleeve, who was stunned, and said quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;Ruda. It&apos;s better to give up this time and go outside. Once a fight starts, it won&apos;t stop. If you get caught up in it, you&apos;ll die.&quot;<br/><br/>A hunter can&apos;t survive if he gets teased. Once you get attacked, hit back. If you give it back, give it back even more. It&apos;s a negative chain. Even if it&apos;s a stray bullet, I won&apos;t forgive it, so it won&apos;t end until the last person runs out of energy.<br/><br/>Tino shrugs his shoulders and carefully checks his toes. A familiar behavior--he was about to blow his head off.<br/>A well-trained hunter&apos;s kicks easily cause the ground to cave in and blow away walls.<br/>The person who protects the treasure hall---it&apos;s unbelievable because he crushes a ``phantom&apos;&apos; that even heavy weapons can&apos;t penetrate with a single blow.<br/><br/>&quot;Well, wait...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&apos;m confident in my ability to detect a crisis. Now, before the fight starts...&quot;<br/><br/>&#x201C;But, I came here to find a party!?&#x201D;<br/><br/> It impossible. Even their brains have become muscles. Life is more important than parties.<br/>That&apos;s how I managed to survive for five years. Ruda doesn&apos;t know about high-level hunters&apos; fights.<br/><br/>I really should have never come to a place like this. She tries to convince him, almost crying.<br/><br/>&quot;I-I understand. I&apos;ll help you find it! I&apos;ll help you next time! Right now, my life is more important.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;!? I-I understand. I understand.&quot;<br/><br/>The temperature inside the room, which was already filled with heat, rose even more.<br/><br/>The great sword the boy was holding was on fire. Noble Phantasm. A tool with supernatural powers. The flaming crimson that clings to the sword body does not spread any further, illuminating Tino&apos;s cool face.<br/><br/>I crawl around the corner and head for the exit.<br/><br/>I feel miserable. But it&apos;s safe. A loud exchange can be heard from behind.<br/><br/>&quot;I&apos;ll think about it after I kill it. I learned this from my sister.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&apos;s okay, little one. Come on, I can&apos;t help you!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are you licking me? Hmm? If you&apos;re going to do it, do it outside! Outside!&quot;<br/><br/>If we do it outside, the Imperial Knights will definitely come flying at us. Even now, everyone is sensitive to scandals involving hunters. If ordinary people are involved, it won&apos;t be enough.<br/><br/>The third party&apos;s instigation continues. I didn&apos;t want to think about it, but it was the voice of a Footprint member. Too chaotic.<br/><br/>&quot;Okay, let&apos;s go! Lady--fai!!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&apos;t provoke me!&quot;<br/><br/>A voice like a scream. Vulgar whistles and taunts. The hustle and bustle. As we secretly head for the exit, someone signals us to start.<br/><br/>Almost at the same time&#x2015;&#x2015;the wind blew.<br/><br/>The hot air was instantly swept away and blown through. The sudden shock made me flinch. The hood can be removed.<br/>Ruda, who was following behind, let out a short scream.<br/><br/>A shadow suddenly appears in my field of vision. My heart is beating fast. I looked up in horror.<br/>Ruda opens her eyes and whispers softly.<br/><br/>&quot;Uh... when... in between...&quot;<br/><br/>Transparent eyes like black diamonds were looking down at me. This is Tino, who was supposed to be facing the boy a while ago.<br/>Her cut black hair flows smoothly after a moment&apos;s delay. In front of me was a pair of supple, exposed legs.<br/>Instead of the sullen expression from earlier, he now has a blank expression looking down at me.<br/><br/>&#x201C;Ah, uh&#x2026; something&#x2026;?&#x201D;<br/><br/>Ruda asked fearfully.<br/>Tino didn&apos;t answer, but he said to me in a voice that was just as trembling.<br/><br/>&quot;...Um... what are you doing? Masuta? Since when have you been here?&quot;<br/><br/>Ah...I feel like I&apos;m going to puke.</body></html>
