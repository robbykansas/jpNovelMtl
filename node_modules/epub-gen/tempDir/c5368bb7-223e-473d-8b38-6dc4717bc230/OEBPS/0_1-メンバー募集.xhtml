<body><h1>1 &#x30E1;&#x30F3;&#x30D0;&#x30FC;&#x52DF;&#x96C6;</h1>Let&apos;s become a treasure hunter.

It&apos;s a story from a long time ago, when I was a child less than ten years old.
One of my friends and childhood friend from the group I always played with said.
He was a reckless, strong-armed, but brave male friend.

Let&apos;s become a treasure hunter. Visit treasure halls all over the world and gain wealth and glory.
His only goal is to become the world&apos;s strongest hero. If it&apos;s us... if it&apos;s these six people, I&apos;m sure we can do it.

My friend, who is very fast and dexterous, agreed to my proposal, which had no basis whatsoever.
My friend, who loves reading books, timidly followed suit, and my friend, who is a bit quiet but reliable, nodded loudly.
My sister, who had always followed me, looked at me, and I agreed with her.

Treasure hunters, who travel to ruins all over the country and bring back many mysterious treasures, have always been popular. There is no faster way to acquire wealth, honor, and everything that exists in this world and become a hero.

Of course, there are risks. There is an enormous risk called death.

&#x3000;And several years. As a result of working hard together, we successfully obtained the qualifications to become hunters.
However, if you apply for a hunter qualification, you can get it right away.

A brave, reckless, and strong-armed male friend becomes an unparalleled swordsman, and a very quick and dexterous friend becomes a thief who can see through traps and lead the entire party (not that he&apos;s a thief, but in general) ).
And the other friends as well--for better or worse, each of them had the unique talent needed to be a hunter.
A glimpse of this was already clear before he became a hunter, when he was training for different roles.

I was the only one who didn&apos;t have talent.

I was the only one who couldn&apos;t do anything better than the average person no matter what I did.
Four friends, my sister, and me. I was the only one out of six people. I was the only one who couldn&apos;t do anything.

I was the only one who couldn&apos;t see the path to becoming a hero.
That was already five years ago.



&#xA7;&#x3000;&#xA7;&#x3000;&#xA7;



I&apos;ve been in the worst mood since this morning.

Thick black clouds covered the sky. When I close my eyes, all I hear is the sound of raindrops hitting the ground. The smell of water. The smell of mud.
The ground was completely muddy due to the bad weather that had continued for three days. It&apos;s still daytime, but it&apos;s dark outside.

In front of a sturdy-looking stone building. Despite the pouring rain, there were many people of all ages and genders lined up.

There are those with dead eyes, those who are screaming and yelling, and not only those who are pure humans, but also those who exhibit characteristics of other races. The only thing they have in common is that most of them are dressed in obscene manners.

It was wearing dirty armor that I didn&apos;t even know what kind of leather it was made of. He wears a thick cloak that covers his whole body. Some of them are even equipped with heavy metal armor that covers their entire bodies. Many carry weapons such as swords and heavy weapons.

Due to the bad weather, there were almost no people on the street, and that one area was enveloped in a strange heat.
Everyone gathered here in search of the slim chance that existed.

In order to show off his skills to a famous active treasure hunter and have him join his party.

Treasure hunting has always been a popular occupation.

The risks are extremely high among many jobs, but if you have talent, you can get wealth, honor, power, everything. That kind of glory is something that is absolutely out of your reach unless you are born into an aristocratic family or a famous merchant family.

Hunters often work in groups of several people called parties. If you can join a party with many experienced hunters, you can significantly reduce the risk compared to starting from scratch.
Active hunters are also always looking for skilled companions. This was the kind of event that was being held here.

I didn&apos;t think there would be many people because it was raining, but it seems like there are quite a lot of people. I let out a sigh and lined up at the back of the line.

Because there was no roof, everyone lined up outside was soaking wet.
I put the hood attached to my cloak over my head and waited, trying to shrink myself down. I feel anxious when I&apos;m standing in line alone, even if I don&apos;t have any acquaintances.

&#x201C;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Why, there are so many people! We can&#x2019;t even go inside!

An irritated scream rose from the front and I cringed even further.

The waiting list is already terrible, but it&apos;s even worse because it&apos;s cold and raining. I understand your frustration, but it&apos;s the same for everyone.
Hunters have strong arms. There are many people who are short-tempered. If a fight breaks out and people get involved, no one will be happy.

One of Hunter&apos;s talents is his physique. I&apos;m of average size, but most of the men around me were a head bigger than me.
They are monsters wearing the skin of people who have the ability and courage to calmly fight monsters with powers that far exceed those of humans.

All I can do is pray that the situation passes as peacefully as possible.

Fortunately, it seems that the prayer was delivered this time, which is rare, and it didn&apos;t escalate into any more trouble.
The line moves forward a little. As I cringed and was careful not to make eye contact with anyone, the person in front of me suddenly turned to look at me.

Beautiful blue eyes reflect me.

&quot;Hey, wait? Are you also a party wannabe?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes&quot;

It&apos;s an unusually bright voice. I reluctantly look a little below my eyes because it seems like I&apos;ll get into trouble if I ignore it.

The person who called out to me was a female hunter in her late teens. She has well-groomed light brown hair and big blue eyes. She wears a long coat and a large pouch set on a sturdy belt. Her attire was standard hunter clothing, but with her undamaged hair and friendly features, she didn&apos;t look like a hunter exploring a dangerous hoard. Her clothes are almost new and there are no stains.

In this day and age, female hunters are not uncommon, but from my experience, hunters with this kind of atmosphere can generally be divided into two types.

Someone who is about to become a hunter, or has just become one, and is still full of hope.
And a true ``monster&apos;&apos; like my old friends, who has an outstanding talent that can become a hero, and who has not lost his luster even after countless adventures.

Although most of the time it&apos;s the former, we can&apos;t let our guard down. This industry is full of monsters wearing human skin.

The female hunter gave me a wry smile as I looked at her with suspicious eyes, but she immediately held out her hand with a bright expression on her face.

She doesn&apos;t seem like the kind of person who would immediately attack someone.

I secretly set that hunter to risk level E in my head. This is the level of danger given to hunters who look safe on the surface.

&quot;I&apos;m Ruda Rumbek. I&apos;m a level 3 hunter. I just got promoted.&quot;

Level 3 hunter...mid-level? It seems much better than it looks.

I silently reset the danger level of the woman in front of me to D. At least he doesn&apos;t seem to be a new hunter.

Treasure hunters are given levels according to their achievements by the Explorer Association, commonly known as the ``Exploration Association,&apos;&apos; which collectively manages them.
There are up to 10 levels, but level 3 is a level that guarantees mid-level ability and achievements.

There is a statistic that 70% of all hunters stop at level 3, so Ruda is promising because she has reached that level even though she is still young.

There&apos;s no harm in being cautious.

she opens her lips. She hadn&apos;t drunk a single drop of water since morning, and the voice that came out of her mouth was extremely dry, probably because she had run all the way here.

&quot;I&apos;m... Cry Andrich... Nice to meet you, Ruda.&quot;

I answered without holding her hand.

The biggest thing I gained from my five years of hunting was a sense of crisis.
Because she might be thrown the moment she grasps it. It might be thrown, or it might be crushed. There is a good chance that you will be killed the moment you hold my hand.

Of course, she could be considered an enemy for not shaking hands.

Ruda frowned for a moment, but then she said brightly:

&quot;Are you solo too? Everyone was feeling tingly - I didn&apos;t like it.&quot;

&#x201C;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D;

&quot;I&apos;ve been a solo hunter for a long time, but lately I&apos;ve been hitting a wall... and that&apos;s when I heard that there was a large-scale recruitment of hunters, so I came here.&quot;

A sheath hung from the belt around her waist. She taps the dagger hanging there.

There are various gimmicks in the treasure hall. The fact that he only has a dagger with low killing power means that Ruda is a hunter who is better at disarming gimmicks than fighting monsters.

No, those skills are essential for solo activities.
Conquering the treasure hall requires several skills, and it is extremely difficult to cover them all by yourself.
Not all treasure hunters necessarily engage in treasure hunting in treasure halls, but in order to receive Level 3 certification, they must have a track record of conquering treasure halls. If he has the ability to accomplish this as a solo artist, it makes sense that he was able to receive that recognition in such a short period of time.

I guess he is what is commonly called a ``genius.&apos;&apos;

I don&apos;t know what to say, so I can&apos;t help but smile.

One of the few things I&apos;ve learned over the past few years is that when you&apos;re in trouble, just smile and you&apos;ll be fine.

&quot;Alone...you do a lot of crazy things.&quot;

&quot;Yes! That&apos;s right! I went to the White Wolf&apos;s Den, but I just didn&apos;t have enough time...&quot;

Ruda&apos;s eyes sparkled, as if she was hungry for a conversation partner.

&quot;That&apos;s why...I thought I&apos;d invite you to join another party. They say that you can easily conquer &apos;White Wolf&apos;s Den&apos; with five Level 3 players...&quot;

&quot;Huh. &apos;White Wolf&apos;s Den&apos;? Are you saying that you understand what kind of place this place is?&quot;

At the sudden voice that made fun of me, Ruda&apos;s expression suddenly turned grim.

The owner of the voice was a large man who was standing in front of me. Leather armor is a combination of metal and leather, and the cloak is darkened with blood stains. If Ruda is a shiny first-year hunter, he has the appearance of a veteran warrior.
Hunters aren&apos;t limited to these guys, there are many with a strong bloodlust. Moreover, his bloodlust tends to increase in proportion to his skill.
It&apos;s even said in the Exploration Association that having a lot of blood is the quality of a hunter.

As expected, Ruda fearlessly yelled at the large man who was two heads taller than her.

&quot;What? All of a sudden! Are you even complaining!?&quot;

&quot;Wait, are you a level 3 hunter? &apos;White Wolf&apos;s Den&apos;? This isn&apos;t the kind of place where amateurs who have just become hunters gather.&quot;

The big man twitched, his cheeks twitching, and a smile that could hardly be called a smile appeared. The other people in line were looking at the big man and Ruda as if they were annoying or even interesting.

I secretly took a step back. Be very careful not to get involved in a fight. That was also something I learned after becoming a hunter. No one will help you if you get caught and injured.

&quot;The people gathered here are all people who are confident in their own abilities. After all, the party that is recruiting members here is one that belongs to that &apos;Footprints&apos;, right? Even though it is a new party, in this imperial capital. It&apos;s the most powerful clan right now. No matter how much we do, if we have newcomers like Teme in the mix, we&apos;re going to cause trouble!&quot;

A clan is a form of group of hunters.
A party is a group formed by several hunters who usually act together. A clan is formed when multiple parties come together.
There are various reasons for the formation. For example, information sharing. Flexibility of items. You can borrow or borrow members if you don&apos;t have enough members, or you can challenge together when challenging a highly difficult treasure room.
Horizontal connections are essential for the smooth functioning of hunters. Therefore, the exploration association also recommended the formation of a clan.

The party recruitment that is being held at this location this time is also led by the clan.

``Footprints&apos;&apos; is one of the famous clans in this imperial city of Zebuldia.

The official name is ``Footsteps of the Beginning (First Step)&apos;&apos;. It is a clan to which many famous young parties belong, and although its history is still short, it is also a clan that is currently growing its influence in the imperial capital.

Normally, hunter party members are recruited whenever needed, but in ``Footprints,&apos;&apos; the parties they belong to are gathered together once a year to conduct a large-scale recruitment of members. That was this place now.

Applicants, regardless of their age or level of origin, can take a test with a member of Footprint, and if they meet the criteria, they will be accepted as a member of the party.
Of course, the average level of the hunters in the ``Footprints&apos;&apos; party is high. Very few people pass, but it seems like a great opportunity for hunters who have no connections and are confident in their skills.

However, that is a mistake. The member of the party that belongs to Footprints is Kamisumi, a hunter from the imperial capital. My friends were like that, but their talent is more abnormal than genius, and most people who wish to take the test end up having their confidence shattered to shreds.

&quot;Huh? It was written in the recruitment that level and hunter experience were not an issue, and I&apos;m a level 3 to begin with!?&quot;

&quot;Huh! It&apos;s true that they say that level 3 hunters are mid-level! There are so many level 3 hunters in my footprints!&quot;

The big man yelled at Ruda, who bared his teeth.

The big man is right. Level 3 is just mid-level -- just average. For a prestigious party, a level 3 title probably has no value. Most of the members of Footprints are level 3 or higher.
However, the fact that Ruda is level 3 is just the current story. I said that 70% of hunters finish at level 3, but if you have the ability, your level will increase rapidly. If you can get it up to 3 solo, it shouldn&apos;t be difficult to get it higher if you form a party and have a chance.

That&apos;s why there are no level restrictions when recruiting members for Footprints.

I thought in my heart that this was a terrible accusation, but I held my breath. It&apos;s better not to say unnecessary things.
While they were watching silently, Ruda and the big man were getting more and more heated.

The big man cursing and ostentatiously touching the sword on his waist.
A long sword with a blade length of about one meter. Unlike the dagger that Ruda carries, it is a weapon that can be used to slash and kill monsters and illusions head-on.
Ruda, who carries a dagger, has a heavy burden. It&apos;s unlikely that the big man will be lower than level 3.

&quot;Huh? You mean let&apos;s do it? Fine, let&apos;s do it against each other.&quot;

However, Ruda showed no signs of backing down even after seeing the situation. His handsome mouth curves into a wild smile.
Just like the big man, I stroke the dagger on his waist once, then pull it out in a mesmerizing motion.

Treasure hunters are non-human. If a hunter and a civilian got into a fight, the hunter would be unilaterally made the bad guy, but in the case of a fight between hunters, it would be the one who drew his weapon first who would be the bad guy.
That&apos;s probably why the big man, who had as much blood rushing to his head as Ruda, didn&apos;t draw his sword first. He&apos;s used to fighting.
Now, even if Ruda was beaten to a pulp by a giant man whose name she didn&apos;t know, there was no room for extenuating circumstances. Even if there is a difference in the level of certification as a hunter, it will not be considered in court.

Monsters. Why did something like this happen to me when I was just waiting in line?

As I was getting tired of the rain, wind, and the fight that was breaking out in front of me, a man wearing a white uniform like that worn by imperial soldiers came out of the building.
There is a silver mark on his collar that resembles a footprint. This is proof of being a member of the clan, First Step.

He&apos;s as ferocious as a big man. There was a deep scar etched on his cheek, and he took turns glaring at the big man and Ruda with stern eyes.
He yelled in a voice as rough as the two of them.

&quot;Hey, stop fighting! If you&apos;re going to fight, do it somewhere else! I&apos;ll kick you out without a test!&quot;

The large man who was about to draw his sword clicked his tongue and put it back. Ruda also put away the dagger, even as she pulled his cheek.
Then, the line slowly began to move.</body></html>
